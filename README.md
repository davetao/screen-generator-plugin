# Screen Generator Plugin

This is an Android Studio plugin, which helps you automate your everyday development by generating all necessary files for your project's architecture when you are creating a new screen.

For example, you are using MVP architecture and you are creating a Main screen. You can set up the plugin to generate for you:
<ul>
<li>MainActivity.kt</li>
<li>MainView.kt</li>
<li>MainPresenter.kt</li>
<li>activity_main.xml</li>
</ul>

And also you can set dynamically changing content of all files depending on screen's name, base Android component and other variables.

## How to install?

You can simply install it in Android Studio in Preferences -> Plugins -> Browse repositories and search for Screen Generator.
